# Human-Detector
A passive infrared sensor is used in our design that receives infrared rays to detect alive human beings. As 
human body emits IR, it will be received by the PIR (passive infrared sensor) and once a human being will be 
located, a LED will light up and a buzzer will start buzzing as acknowledgement. 

# Features:
* Navigating the bot in four direction.
* Detecting alive human beings.
* Light up in darkness, depending on the intensity of the available light.
* Controlling the bot through an android device.
* After detecting human beings, as an acknowledgement, tunes a buzzer and lights up a LED.
